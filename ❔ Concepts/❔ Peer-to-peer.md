A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of computer network in which nodes (also called "peers") communicate and share resources directly with one another, rather than through a central server. In a P2P network, each node acts as both a client and a server, allowing it to both request and provide resources to other nodes in the network.

P2P networks are decentralized, meaning there is no central authority or central server that controls the network. This makes P2P networks highly resilient and scalable, as the network can continue to operate even if individual nodes fail or become unavailable.

P2P networks are used for a wide range of applications, including file sharing, distributed computing, and decentralized messaging. They are also used in distributed databases and other distributed computing applications.

Examples of P2P networks include [[BitTorrent]], a popular file sharing network, and [[ðŸš§ Bitcoin]], a decentralized digital currency system.
