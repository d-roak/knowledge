1. 0 is a natural number
2. x = x
3. if x = y, y = x
4. if x = y and y = z then x = z
5. if b is a natural number and a = b, then a is also a natural number
6. There's a function S, such that S(n) is a natural number (S = successor function)
7. m = n if and only if S(m) = S(n)
8. There's no n such that S(n) = 0
9. If K is a set such that
	1. 0 is in K
	2. If n is in K it means that S(n) is in K
	3. Then K contains every natural number
