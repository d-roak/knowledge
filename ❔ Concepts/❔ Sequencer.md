Sequencers are nodes which receive new rollup transactions from users, combine the transactions into a block, and post that block to the consensus and data availability layer. A block consists of two components: a block header, and the actual transaction data. The block header contains, amongst other things, a cryptographic commitment to the state of the chain—usually a Merkle root.
