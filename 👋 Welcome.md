Hello and welcome to my public learning space!

If your heart skips a beat for [[Distributed Systems]], [[Security]], [[Blockchains]], or you find yourself drawn to the wonders of Low-level stuff and Random curiosities, then you've come to the right place. Make yourself at home!

Ready to explore? Pick a note at random or dive right into the graph. Who knows, you might just stumble upon something new and exciting!

Currently there are lots of unstructured and incomplete information, but I promise I will fix it soon enough! In the meantime you can create a PR [here](https://github.com/d-roak/knowledge).

If you're in the mood to connect further, I'd love for you to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/droak_) or [GitHub](https://github.com/d-roak). Let's keep the conversation going!

If any of my notes spark a lightbulb moment for you and you feel like showing your appreciation, I'm always open to receiving your most unloved coins at [droak.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1397548067fF5A6e18bcf6d9D99B0ee029cB78b). But hey, if you prefer the old-fashioned way, feel free to buy me a beer at the next crypto conference!

Enjoy your time here and happy learning!
