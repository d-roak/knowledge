Radius is a [[Shared Sequencer]] designed to eliminate harmful [[MEV]] and censorship while creating economic value for [[Rollups]]. It uses an encrypted [[Mempool]] with [[PVDE]] (Practical Verifiable Delay Encryption), an advanced cryptography and ZK-based scheme. [[PVDE]] ensures that the transactions ordering process is trustless, preventing centralized [[Sequencers]] from engaging in [[Frontrunning]], [[Sandwiching]], and censoring transactions.
